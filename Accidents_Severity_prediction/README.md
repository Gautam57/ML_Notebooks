# Severity Prediction for US Accidents  

## Overview  
This project analyzes and predicts the severity of traffic accidents across the United States using machine learning techniques. The dataset covers 49 states and includes data from 2016 to 2023, collected via multiple APIs from sources like transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and sensors.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains approximately **7.7 million accident records** with key features such as:  
- **ID**: Unique accident record identifier.  
- **Source**: Origin of the raw accident data.  
- **Severity**: Scale from 1 (least impact) to 4 (high impact).  
- **Start_Time & End_Time**: Time duration of the accident.  
- **Location Data**: Latitude, longitude, city, state, and ZIP code.  
- **Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and visibility.  
- **Traffic Signals**: Presence of stop signs, traffic lights, and junctions.  

## Objectives  
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand accident trends.  
- Build **machine learning models** to predict accident severity.  
- Evaluate model performance and optimize for accuracy.  
- Provide insights to improve road safety and traffic management.  

## Model Implementation  
The project explores different machine learning techniques, including:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Gradient Boosting Models**
