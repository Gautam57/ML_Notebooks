# Stroke Prediction using Supervised Learning Classification

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a stroke occurring based on various health and demographic features. Using supervised machine learning classification techniques, we analyze a dataset and develop a predictive model to assist in early stroke detection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about patients, including attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, and lifestyle factors. These features are used to train and evaluate different classification models.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Stroke Prediction using Supervised Learning Classification.ipynb`.
- Run the cells step by step to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
- Modify hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve predictions.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Results
The notebook includes detailed performance analysis of each model, comparing their effectiveness in stroke prediction.
